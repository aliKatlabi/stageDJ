# /assets/meta/README.md

This folder contains metadata that defines:
- roles (performer categories)
- outfits (wardrobe presets)
- loop assets (audio loops and vocal loops)
These files should be treated as the content contract of the app.
Adding new outfits/loops should usually not require code changes.
